            <h2>About Aura</h2>
            <p>
                Founded by Tedd James <strong>(TJ)</strong> in 2024, Aura is a modern perfume brand 
                dedicated to the art of elegant fragrances. With Its Head-quarters located in Nairobi,
                Kenya, this brand brings together the spirit of African elegance and contemporary luxury.
                We believe that a great scent is not just a product but a culture and a statement of 
                individuality.
